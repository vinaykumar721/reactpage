        <img src={connect4} class="img"/>

        <li>This game is played on a vertical board wich has seven hollow columns and six rows.</li>
        <li>Each column has a hole in the upper part of the board, where pieces are introduced.</li> 
        <li>There is a window for every square, so that pieces can be seen from both sides.</li>
        <li>In short, itÂ´s a vertical board with 42 windows distributed in 6 rows and 7 columns.</li> 
        <li>Both players have a set of 21 thin pieces (like coins); each of them uses a different colour.</li>
        <li>The board is empty at the start of the game.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>The aim for both players is to make a straight line of four own pieces; the line can be vertical, horizontal or diagonal.</p>
      <h2>How the game goes on</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>Before starting, players decide randomly which of them will be the beginner; moves are made alternatively, one by turn.</li>
      <li>Moves entails in placing new pieces on the board; pieces slide downwards from upper holes, falling down to the last row or piling up on the last piece introduced in the same column.</li>
      <li>So, in every turn the introduced piece may be placed at most on seven different squares.</li>
      <li>The winner is the first player who gets a straight line made with four own pieces and no gaps between them.</li>
      </ul>
